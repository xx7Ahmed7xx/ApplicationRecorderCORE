## Introduction
As a Software Engineer, we always stumble upon difficulties. One of them brough you here - perhabs - and made me create this amazing repository.
## What is it about

One for the library, Which you can reference in your project and use to your own needs and ways.  
The other one for demo app, Which shows how the code is being used to record the screen.

## References
It was a tough task at the beginning and had my head spinning for days. So after careful reviewing, checking, testing, adjustments. I managed to create this awesome piece of code which you won't find as a one part ANYWHERE on the internet.
